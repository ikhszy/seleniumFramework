# seleniumFramework

My selenium solo project for my own improvement as QA engineer. Using http://automationpractice.com/ as base URL. Some of the things to note:
1. I'm using Selenium Java running on Eclipse
2. TestNG
3. Maven for build
4. Jenkins
5. Google Spreadsheet for test document.

**Update 1 (April 17th 2022)**

finally finished the framework setup and Jenkins(!) to be able to run locally. Will start working with Test Document to serve as the base document.
