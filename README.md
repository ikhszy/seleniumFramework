# seleniumFramework

My selenium solo project for my own improvement as QA engineer. Using http://automationpractice.com/ as base URL. Some of the things to note:
1. I'm using Selenium Java running on Eclipse
2. TestNG
3. Maven for build
4. Jenkins
5. Google Spreadsheet for test document.

**Update 1 (April 17th 2022)**

finally finished the framework setup and Jenkins(!) to be able to run locally. Will start working with Test Document to serve as the base document.

**Update 2 (April 18th 2022)**

i have created the [test document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17utnwZVr8mJxD0CebvBus2IQofOxvpZAbo-YK69px2U/edit?usp=sharing) and major updates on login function automation. Jenkins build run smoothly, although it takes some times due to my poor internet connection. Feel free to leave a comment if anything missing on the doc (i have opened the doc for everyone to comment, but not edit ðŸ˜¼). Next target is sign up page. I probably gonna ask for peer review on the test case for the next one.
