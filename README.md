# seleniumFramework

My selenium solo project for my own improvement as QA engineer. Using http://automationpractice.com/ as base URL. Will gradually post updates here.

**Update 1 (April 17th 2022)**
finally finished the framework setup and Jenkins(!) to be able to run locally. Will start working with Test Documents to serve as the base documents.
